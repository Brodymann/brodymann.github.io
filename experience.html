          <p>I worked as a commercial fisherman in the Bering Sea and Bristol Bay, catching different species of
            Crab, Cod, and Salmon for extended periods of time. I excelled at handling 
            high-pressure situations and meeting tight deadlines in vastly diverse environments, on very little sleep. 
            My first captain once said, "If you can complete a season of crab fishing in AK, you can achieve anything". He was right. </p>
